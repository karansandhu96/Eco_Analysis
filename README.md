# Eco_Analysis

# This project demonstrates how to explore and analyze real-world economic data using Python libraries Pandas and the Federal Reserve Economic Data (FRED) API.

# Project Overview

This project equips you with the skills to:
1. Search for economic indicators on the FRED database
2. Download economic data programmatically using the FRED API
3. Clean, analyze, and visualize economic data with Pandas and Plotly

# Requirements
1. Python 3.x (Download from https://www.python.org/downloads/)
2. Required libraries:
a. Pandas (pip install pandas)
b. NumPy (pip install numpy)
c. Matplotlib (pip install matplotlib)
d. Plotly (pip install plotly)

A FRED API key (Obtain one for free from FRED website)
Note: These instructions assume you have a basic understanding of Python programming and some familiarity with data analysis concepts.

# Folder Structure
The project will typically consist of a single Jupyter Notebook file (.ipynb) containing all the code and comments.

# Code Walkthrough
This project leverages a Jupyter Notebook for interactive code execution and exploration. Here's a breakdown of the key steps in the provided code:

# Import Libraries:
Import essential libraries like Pandas (pandas as pd), NumPy (numpy as np), Matplotlib (matplotlib.pyplot as plt), and Plotly (plotly.express as px) for data manipulation and visualization.

# Install FRED API Library (if needed):
Run the command !pip install fredapi within a code cell to install the FRED API library if it's not already present in your environment.

# Import FRED API Library:
Import the installed fredapi library to interact with the FRED API.

# Set Pandas Options (Optional):
Customize Pandas display options (e.g., maximum column width) using pd.set_option(). You can also define color palettes for visualizations.

# Load FRED API Key:
Replace the placeholder with your actual method of obtaining the key (e.g., environment variables or secure storage mechanisms).

# Create FRED Object:
Instantiate a FRED object using your API key to interact with the FRED database.

# Search for Economic Data:
Utilize the fred.search() method to retrieve a list of economic indicators based on a search term (e.g., 'SP500').

# Sort Search Results:
Optionally sort the search results by popularity or other relevant criteria using Pandas sorting functions.

# Download Specific Data:
Use the fred.get_series() method to download data for a chosen economic indicator by its series ID (obtained from the search results).

#  Data Exploration and Visualization:
Employ Pandas functionalities for data cleaning and manipulation as needed.
Create informative visualizations using Matplotlib or Plotly libraries based on your preference.

# Further Exploration
The provided code serves as a springboard for exploring various economic indicators available on FRED.  Feel free to modify the code to analyze different data sets, identify interesting trends, and conduct further economic analysis based on your interests.

This README provides a high-level overview of the project.  For detailed code execution and explanations, refer to the provided Jupyter Notebook file.
